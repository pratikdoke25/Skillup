                <h2>Shipping</h2>
                <p><strong>Shipping Time:</strong> Orders are usually processed and shipped within 48 hours. Please note personalised items will take longer to process. If your order contains both personalised and non-personalised items, the order will be split, and the non-personalised items will be delivered beforehand.</p>
                <p><strong>Shipping Charges:</strong> We offer free shipping on all orders over ₹449. Please note that we do not offer free shipping on international orders and returns.</p>
                <p><strong>Tracking:</strong> You will receive tracking details via WhatsApp, email, and SMS once your order is shipped. In case you're ordering other items along with personalised or gold jewellery, your order might arrive in parts.</p>
                <p class="important-note">Note: Deliveries may experience delays due to unforeseen circumstances such as weather, holidays, or operational issues.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="handling-info">
                <h2>Handling Time</h2>
                <p>All orders are carefully packaged and dispatched within 1-2 business days. However, during peak seasons such as holidays or sales, handling times may extend up to 3-4 business days.</p>
                <p>We ensure that all fragile items are packed securely to avoid damage during transit. Special care is taken for high-value items, which are double-boxed for extra protection.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tracking-info">
                <h2>Order Tracking</h2>
                <p>After your order is dispatched, you will receive an email with a tracking ID. You can use this ID to track the status of your delivery on our courier partner's website.</p>
                <p class="important-note">Important: Please ensure that someone is available at the delivery address to receive the package. Our courier partner will attempt delivery up to 3 times before returning the package.</p>

                <p><strong>Return Policy:</strong> We offer a 30-day return policy for all unused and unworn items, no questions asked. However, please note that the 30-day return does not apply to personalised jewellery, perfumes, candles, coins, utensils, and God idols other than in cases of defective or spurious products. GIVA reserves the right to process refunds after checking the returned items.</p>
                <p>In case you have purchased a GIVA product from anywhere other than the GIVA Website, GIVA App or GIVA Exclusive Stores, the return policies of your source of purchase shall apply.</p>
                <p><strong>Refund Policy:</strong> In case you have requested the return of any of your products, the refund will be initiated once we receive the product back in our warehouse.</p>
                <p><strong>Replacement & Exchange:</strong> You can also request a replacement or exchange as per your requirements. The same conditions apply as for returns. The replacement will only be shipped after the initial return has been picked up or delivered (for Gold items).</p>
                <p><strong>Return Process:</strong> You can initiate a return request from our website or app, or contact Customer Support for assistance. We request you to be available for reverse pick-up and to answer calls from the delivery partner. In case you're unavailable, the pick-up may be canceled, and the process will need to be restarted.</p>
                <p>In rare cases, some pin codes may only be forward serviceable. In such cases, we may ask you to return the product via alternate courier services, such as India Post, and reimburse reasonable shipping costs (up to ₹70).</p>
                <p class="important-note">Note: If you receive an empty parcel or missing product, please contact our customer support team within 48 hours with a 360-degree unpacking video for further assistance. Claims without sufficient evidence may not be honored.</p>
